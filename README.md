## Dataset : <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand'> Here </a>

## Intro
In this repo, i tried to help the companies to predict whether the customer will cancel the booking or not.We have all the booking
details like arrival date year, stays in week nights, arrival date day of month etc... of the customers from various countries.

I do some data analysis to answer some questions
  
  How Many Booking Were Cancelled?
  
  What is the booking ratio between Resort Hotel and City Hotel?
  
  What is the percentage of booking for each year?

  Which is the busiest month for hotels?

  From which country most guests come?

  How Long People Stay in the hotel?
  
  Which was the most booked accommodation type (Single, Couple, Family)?
  
After that, l made the predictive model to make predictions in the future whether the booking will be canceled or not

## Detailes of the dataset
An Online travel booking company is suffering from loss in revenue because of the uncertain booking cancelation of its customers. The company wants to
know which customer will cancel the booking. As a data-scientist we have to help the company to predict whether the customer will cancel the booking or
not.We have all the booking details like arrival_date_year, stays_in_week_nights, arrival_date_day_of_month etc of the customers from
various countries.We have to do some data analysis to answer some questions and we have to work on Machine Learning models to help predict whether the
customer will cancel the booking or not.We will focus on Exploratory Data Analysis for answering business questions first and then move on to the prediction approach.
