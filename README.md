# Detailes of the dataset
An Online travel booking company is suffering from loss in revenue because of the uncertain booking cancelation of its customers. The company wants to
know which customer will cancel the booking. As a data-scientist we have to help the company to predict whether the customer will cancel the booking or
not.We have all the booking details like arrival_date_year, stays_in_week_nights, arrival_date_day_of_month etc of the customers from
various countries.We have to do some data analysis to answer some questions and we have to work on Machine Learning models to help predict whether the
customer will cancel the booking or not.We will focus on Exploratory Data Analysis for answering business questions first and then move on to the prediction approach.
